Data Types:
Integers and Floating Point Numbers: Go supports various integer and floating-point numeric types (int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, float32, float64, etc.).
Strings: Represented as a sequence of bytes (string type) and have built-in support for Unicode characters.
Arrays: Fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.
Slices: Dynamic and flexible structures built on top of arrays. They are more versatile and commonly used in Go.
Structs: User-defined types that group together variables of different types under one name.
Custom Data Types:
Defining Custom Types: Go allows developers to create custom types based on existing ones, aiding in better code organization and readability.
Maps, Pointers, Channels:
Maps: Key-value data structures used to store unordered collections of elements.
Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses. They are used to manage memory, pass references, and create more efficient data structures.
Channels: Mechanism for communication and synchronization between Goroutines (concurrent functions).
Control Structures:
If-Else Conditional Statements: Used for decision-making in code execution.
Variable Scope: Go has block-level scoping, and variable visibility is limited to the block they are declared in.
Switch Statements: Alternative to long if-else chains for multiple branching.
Loops:
For Loops: Used for repetitive execution of a block of code. Go has a versatile for loop that can be used in different ways.
Functions:
Function Variables: Functions in Go are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
Package Management: Go supports a built-in package management system through the go command. The introduction of Go modules in recent versions has further improved dependency management and versioning.
